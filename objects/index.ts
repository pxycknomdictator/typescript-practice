// This interface shows what our user object looks like. It includes the user's username, email, password, and address, as well as their credit card information, which consists of the card number, expiry date, and CVV.

interface User {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  address: string;
  CreditCardInformation: {
    card_number: number;
    card_expiry: string;
    cvv: number;
  };
}

// creating a user object

const user_1: User = {
  username: "Noman",
  email: "noman69@gmail.com",
