// In the datatypes folder, we see how to infer objects in TypeScript, but we donâ€™t fully understand it.
// let's go.......
// Basically, TypeScript is all about type safety, so it aims to prevent you from writing unpredictable or unconventional code like JavaScript.

// This interface shows what our user object looks like. It includes the user's username, email, password, and address, as well as their credit card information, which consists of the card number, expiry date, and CVV.

interface User {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  address: string;
  CreditCardInformation: {
    card_number: number;
    card_expiry: string;
    cvv: number;
  };
}

// creating a user object

const user_1: User = {
  username: "Noman",
  email: "noman69@gmail.com",
  password: "MyStrongPassword",
  address: "In my house :P",
  CreditCardInformation: {
    card_number: 2930,
    card_expiry: "00-00-0000",
    cvv: 9090,
  },
};

// what is interface re-opening or interface merging? if you familiar with object oriented programming this is for you lets create a interface

interface Employee {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface Employee {
  admin: boolean;
}

// You can clearly see that I created two interfaces with the same name Employee instead of overriding each other, they merged.

const employee: Employee = {
  username: "Noman",
  email: "noman69@gmail.com",
  password: "shhhhhhhh",
  isActive: false,
  admin: true,
};

/* Here's another way to create object types: using type. So whatâ€™s the difference between type and interface?

  1. Interfaces with the same name will merge, but types will not.
  2. Interfaces are primarily used for object structures, while types can represent all types.

I know this can be a bit confusing! */

// For example
const userName: string = "Noman";

// In this example i just gave my custom name to string type ðŸ˜œ
type myString = string; // :P
const userName1: myString = "Noman";

// just like interface we can create object structure in type

type myObject = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

const user: myObject = {
  name: "batman",
  email: "batman@batman.com",
  password: "Justice",
};

// ===================== summary =====================

/*
  Interface

    Merging: Interfaces with the same name will merge (declaration merging).
    Use Case: Primarily used for defining the shape of objects (like classes and objects).
    Extensibility: Can extend other interfaces using extends.

Type

    No Merging: Types with the same name will result in an error; they do not merge.
    Use Case: Can represent any type, including primitives, unions, intersections, and tuples.
    Flexibility: More versatile, allowing for complex type definitions.

    In short, use interface for object shapes and type for broader type definitions!
