// Hey everyone, this particular section is small because we talk about type annotation and type inference.

// So what is type annotation?
// Type annotation is simply about explicitly assigning a type to any variable.

// So what is type inference
// In TypeScript, it is not necessary to explicitly assign a type to any variable; TypeScript is smart enough to handle that.

// for example

let isAdmin: boolean = true;

let isEmployee = true;

// you don't need to mention that my variable contain this data type
